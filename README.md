Ghost Rider

1. For the first commit - Ghost Rider - Started Artwork 1
I made a rough sketch of the skull of the ghost rider. I then used pencil to roughly shade in the eye socket.
This step took lots of trial and error as it is pivotal in ensuring the final stages of the artwork are done correctly.

2. Ghost Rider - Continued Artwork 2
For this commit I worked on the jawline and teeth for the ghost rider. I shaded in the cheek area and added flicks of graphite to give depth to the drawing.

3. Ghost Rider - Continued Artwork 3
For this commit I focused on the starting the flames and the neck, torso and collar of the ghost rider. I did some indepth shading on the eye and cheek area.

4. host Rider - Finished Artwork 4
I added the flames to the ghost rider and added final details to the shirt, skull, etc.

Hope you like it!
